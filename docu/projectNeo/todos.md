# TODOs
 Preperation work
- [x] add docu for `pkgs` folder in docker repo
- [x] fixed rviz in docker container
- [x] write *com* calculator
- [ ] find joint angles for statically stable matrix pose
- [ ] write package to replicate joint_angles (from echo of topic)
- [ ] write static stability checker
    - [ ] calculate support polygon from feet
    - [ ] check if center of mass is inside polygon of support
- [ ] check if robot could perform evasion strategies (from joint perspective); can be done in rviz
- [ ] move robot step by step into statically stable position
 Optimal Control
- [ ] write pseudo formulation for optimal control problem
- [ ] build inverse kinematics component with *Optimal Control* framework
- [ ] bring robot in evasion pose with inverse kinematics component
